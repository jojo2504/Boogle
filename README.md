### Researches
Researches in french with AI for the implementation of the wordcloud:
```
Afin d‚Äôobtenir un panel complet d‚Äôinformation sur la cr√©ation d‚Äôun nuage de mots, nous avons demand√© √† plusieurs IA de nous en parler. Afin d‚Äôobtenir une r√©ponse en accord avec notre code, nous leurs avons demand√©s de cr√©er un nuage de mots √† partir d‚Äôun dictionnaire contenant en cl√© les mots et en valeur leur occurrence :
	
Selon chatgpt : il faut installer System.Drawing.Common, cela nous permettra d‚Äôafficher une image contenant un nuage de mot. Les mots auront une couleur g√©n√©r√©e al√©atoirement, leur taille d√©pend de l‚Äôoccurrence maximale et de l‚Äôoccurrence minimale contenu dans le dictionnaire et leur position sera al√©atoire. Sa solution comporte malheureusement quelques d√©fauts, le nuage a forc√©ment une forme rectangulaire et les mots dans le nuage peuvent se superposer.
 
Selon Gemini : il nous propose d‚Äôutiliser une biblioth√®que ext√©rieure, WordCloud. Cette solution est assez simple et marche tr√®s bien une fois la biblioth√®que import√©e.

Selon Claude : il nous propose d‚Äôutiliser System.Drawing. Pour cr√©er un nuage de mot, il utilise une classe afin de pouvoir modifier la largeur, la hauteur, et l‚Äôoccurrence minimum d‚Äôun mot pour qu‚Äôil soit affich√© sur le nuage qui est sous forme de Bitmap. Sa solution est la plus compl√®te des trois, elle contient beaucoup d'explications et est cr√©√©e de toute pi√®ce ce qui nous permet de mieux comprendre le fonctionnement. Cette solution r√®gle les probl√®mes des autres, les mots ne peuvent pas se chevaucher, le code ne contient pas de biblioth√®ques import√©es et les couleurs sont harmonieuses.

## Path of work
### Chapter 1 : What's the problem ?
Before starting anything, let's see what we needed to do as for this project.

Recreating the famous boggle by implementing a board which possesses a fixed number of dices, each one having 6 faces with one letter. We will consider this project as having a ***variable number of letters*** but based on a ***weight-based*** system instead of the locked 96 faces and letters. \
[Thanks to Kaimira for providing an open source weighted list in C#.](https://github.com/cdanek/KaimiraWeightedList)

An essential concept of a the game is the need to validate whether or not an inputted word truly exist on the board. But how ? By going through every paths of course, however everyone knows that it will be way to slow to just brute force the solution. Something that we thought was just easier to do was by abandoning *"useless"* paths, which means prefixes with non existant word within itself. (i.e. In `[Maison, Banane]`, the prefix `'Bn'` will be abandoned because there is are no words with the prefix `'Bn'`, in contrary to `'Ma'` in `'Maison'`)

### Chapter 2 : Downsides of mandatory and required methods
For this project, our first idea was to collect all the words from given dictionaries
(french and/or english) and store them in an array which needed to be sorted to use the
mandatory method `RechDichoRecursif` for an element lookup in `ùëÇ(log(ùëÅ))` time complexity.

The problem ? Because we needed process every words and their prefixes, sorting them was in
reality pointless, using too much memory and time for little to no results with `O(ùëÅ^2)` time complexity. \
For example :
```csharp
//get every words in the dictionary
string words = File.ReadAllLines(filePath)[0];
string[] wordsInArray = words.Split(' ');

//then add them to a list and try to proceed them
foreach (string word in wordArray){
   [...]
}
wordArray = wordArray.Sort() 

```
But we still didnt proceed any prefixes nor their length, which demonstrate how long and pointless an implementation like this might be.

### Chapter 3 : Data Structure and algorithm (Trie / Graph)
That's why we came up with another solution, implementing a `Trie`, a specialized ***tree-like*** data structure that stores a ***dynamic*** set of strings, typically to facilitate fast searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is particularly useful for managing dictionaries, auto-complete features, and ***prefix-based search***.

**Time Complexity:** Time complexity depends on the length of the word (L)
- This allow us to insert, search and delete nodes in `ùëÇ(ùêø)`.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity depends on:
- The total number of words, N.
- The average length of words, L.
- The number of unique characters in the alphabet, A.
- Worst-case space complexity: `ùëÇ(ùê¥‚ãÖùêø‚ãÖùëÅ)`

![Trie Data Structure Illustration](/markdownassets/Triedatastructure1.webp)

This will allow us later to keep track of used prefixes during the word search. 

And that's when graphes come into play, a `Graph` is a data structure used to represent ***pairwise relationships between objects***. A graph consists of nodes (`vertices`), which represent the objects, and edges (`arcs`), which represent the connections between these objects. We also need to implement the **adjacency matrix** of a graph connect every vertices to each other.

![Adjacency Mat Graph](/markdownassets/adjacency_mat_graph.webp)

The reasons I used a graph are because :
1) To *Learn*
2) To Facilitate a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm for a complete word search within the board.

For the implementation of the graph, we put in place a custom generic collection `MatrixGraphBuilder<T>` which turned any 2D matrix in its adjacency graph. \
 For example: The board with [A..P], connected vertically, horizontally and diagonally.

1. V is the number of vertices.
2. E is the number of edges.

| Graph Representation | Space Complexity | Add Edge Time | Check Edge Time | Traversal Time |
| -------------------- | ---------------  | ------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
|   Adjacency Matrix   |      O(V^2)      |      O(1)     |      O(1)       |      O(V^2)    |
|   Adjacency List     |      O(V+E)      |      O(1)     |      O(deg)     |      O(V+E)    |
|   Edge List          |      O(E)        |      O(1)     |      O(E)       |      O(E)      |

Here we are using a Adjacency List.

### Chapter 4 : The hard part, finding every possible playable words on the board
The core challenge of the Boogle game lies in identifying all the valid words that can be formed on the board using a *combination* of adjacent letters. This involves a combination of Depth-First Search (`DFS`), `Trie`, and `graph` traversal to systematically explore all possible paths and efficiently check whether they form valid words.

Since some words share prefixes, it‚Äôs **inefficient** to check all possible letter combinations blindly. Instead, we optimize this by abandoning paths where prefixes do not match any valid word in the dictionary.

```csharp
public SortedList<string, string> getAllValidWordsOnBoard(TrieNode trieNode)
{
   SortedList<string, string> sortedWordList = new();
   bool[,] visited;

   // Loop through all nodes in the graph
   foreach (Node<char> node in _graph.Graph.Keys){
      visited = new bool[_boardWidth, _boardHeight];
      DFS(visited, node, string.Empty); // Start DFS from each node
   }

   void DFS(bool[,] visited, Node<char> node, string currentPrefix){
      if (visited[node.Row, node.Col]) return;
      visited[node.Row, node.Col] = true;
      string dfsPrefix = currentPrefix + node.Value;
      
      if (!Trie.SearchPrefix(trieNode, dfsPrefix)){ // Check if the prefix exists in the trie
         visited[node.Row, node.Col] = false;
         return; // Backtrack if the prefix doesn't exist in the Trie
      }
      // If a complete word is found, add it to the result list
      if (Trie.SearchKey(trieNode, dfsPrefix)){
         sortedWordList[dfsPrefix] = dfsPrefix;
      }
      // Recursively explore all neighbors
      if (_graph.Graph.TryGetValue(node, out HashSet<Node<char>> neighbors)){
         foreach (Node<char> neighbor in neighbors)
         {
            bool[,] newVisited = (bool[,])visited.Clone(); // Avoid revisiting nodes in the same path
            DFS(newVisited, neighbor, dfsPrefix);
         }
      }
   }
   return sortedWordList;
}
```

**Detailed Explanation of the Algorithm :**
1. Graph Setup: We initialize a graph where each node corresponds to a letter on the board. An adjacency matrix is created to capture the connections between adjacent nodes (letters).

2. DFS Initialization: We start a DFS from every node on the board, treating each letter as a potential starting point for a word. At each step, we build a string representing the current word path.

3. Prefix Checking: As we build each word path, we check if the current prefix exists in the Trie. If it doesn't, the search terminates early for that path. This prevents unnecessary exploration of paths that cannot lead to a valid word.

4. Word Validation: If the current string matches a full word in the Trie, it is added to a `SortedList<string, string>` of valid words. This ensures that only words present in the dictionary are considered valid, the utilization of SortedList gives us the opportunity the use the mandatory .

## Conlusion :
This project was in fact interesting by putting us in one hand on the utilization and implementation of simple relatively simple things, like creating a board, players, looping through external `.txt` files.
On the other hand, more basic understanding of data structures and algorithms is required like **graph theory**, **set theory**, **DFS approach** and much more by letting us dive into the wild with only ***arrays*** and ***loops***.
Learning to gather unlearned informations was a key method to succeed in the project.
