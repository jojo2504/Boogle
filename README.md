## Introduction
This project explores the design and implementation of a dynamic word game inspired by the popular Boggle game. Our work encompasses a range of tasks, including developing an algorithm to generate a randomized letter grid, implementing efficient word search mechanisms, and ensuring valid word identification using a comprehensive dictionary. We have also focused on creating an engaging user interface, optimizing gameplay mechanics for fairness and fun, and enabling multiplayer functionality for competitive play. Additionally, we analyzed scoring systems, incorporated a timer for added challenge, and tested the application for reliability and usability. This project demonstrates a blend of programming, algorithm design, and user-centric development, offering insights into building interactive games.
### This repository is a project for A2/S3 students in computer sciences.

## Features (TODO)
- Displays the final scores and the winner.

## Features (DONE)
- Supports multiple languages (French and English by default).
- Maintains a list of words found by each player.
- Implement algorithm to find every possible playable words on the current board formed by the dices.
- Generates a word cloud for each player's found words.
- Usable user interface to play the game.
- Customizable game settings, including the size of the game board and the duration of the game.
- Calculates the score of each word based on the point values of the letters and the length of the word.
- Implement the game logic.

## Getting Started (For Custom Building)
1. Clone the repository to your local machine with `git clone --recurse-submodules <repository-url>`
2. Run the project to start the game
   - Use `dotnet run` if you're using .NET, .NET version is `8.0`.
   - For debugging purpose use `dotnet run --property:OutputType=Exe` which forces terminal outputs
3. A prebuild version will be released at the end of the project.

## Usage
1. Play the game
2. Once the game starts, the game board will be displayed, and the first player will have 1 minute to find as many words as possible.
3. The player types in the words they have found, and the game will validate them against the dictionary and calculate the score.
4. After the first player's turn, the next player will have their turn, and so on until the time limit is reached.
5. Enjoy
   
## Implementation Details
1. For the User Interface, the solution will be a **Windows Application WPF**.

## Path of work
### Chapter 1 : What's the problem ?
Before starting anything, let's see what we needed to do as for this project.

Recreating the famous boggle by implementing a board which possesses a fixed number of dices, each one having 6 faces with one letter. We will consider this project as having a ***variable number of letters*** but based on a ***weight-based*** system instead of the locked 96 faces and letters. \
[Thanks to Kaimira for providing an open source weighted list in C#.](https://github.com/cdanek/KaimiraWeightedList)

An essential concept of a the game is the need to validate whether or not an inputted word truly exist on the board. But how ? By going through every paths of course, however everyone knows that it will be way to slow to just brute force the solution. Something that we thought was just easier to do was by abandoning *"useless"* paths, which means prefixes with non existant word within itself. (i.e. In `[Maison, Banane]`, the prefix `'Bn'` will be abandoned because there is are no words with the prefix `'Bn'`, in contrary to `'Ma'` in `'Maison'`)

### Chapter 2 : Downsides of mandatory and required methods
For this project, our first idea was to collect all the words from given dictionaries
(french and/or english) and store them in an array which needed to be sorted to use the
mandatory method `RechDichoRecursif` for an element lookup in `ùëÇ(log(ùëÅ))` time complexity.

The problem ? Because we needed process every words and their prefixes, sorting them was in
reality pointless, using too much memory and time for little to no results with `O(ùëÅ^2)` time complexity. \
For example :
```csharp
//get every words in the dictionary
string words = File.ReadAllLines(filePath)[0];
string[] wordsInArray = words.Split(' ');

//then add them to a list and try to proceed them
foreach (string word in wordArray){
   [...]
}
wordArray = wordArray.Sort() 

```
But we still didnt proceed any prefixes nor their length, which demonstrate how long and pointless an implementation like this might be.

### Chapter 3 : Data Structure and algorithm (Trie / Graph)
That's why we came up with another solution, implementing a `Trie`, a specialized ***tree-like*** data structure that stores a ***dynamic*** set of strings, typically to facilitate fast searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It is particularly useful for managing dictionaries, auto-complete features, and ***prefix-based search***.

**Time Complexity:** Time complexity depends on the length of the word (L)
- This allow us to insert, search and delete nodes in `ùëÇ(ùêø)`.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity depends on:
- The total number of words, N.
- The average length of words, L.
- The number of unique characters in the alphabet, A.
- Worst-case space complexity: `ùëÇ(ùê¥‚ãÖùêø‚ãÖùëÅ)`

![Trie Data Structure Illustration](/markdownassets/Triedatastructure1.webp)

This will allow us later to keep track of used prefixes during the word search. 

And that's when graphes come into play, a `Graph` is a data structure used to represent ***pairwise relationships between objects***. A graph consists of nodes (`vertices`), which represent the objects, and edges (`arcs`), which represent the connections between these objects. We also need to implement the **adjacency matrix** of a graph connect every vertices to each other.

![Adjacency Mat Graph](/markdownassets/adjacency_mat_graph.webp)

The reasons I used a graph are because :
1) To *Learn*
2) To Facilitate a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm for a complete word search within the board.

For the implementation of the graph, we put in place a custom generic collection `MatrixGraphBuilder<T>` which turned any 2D matrix in its adjacency graph. \
 For example: The board with [A..P], connected vertically, horizontally and diagonally.

1. V is the number of vertices.
2. E is the number of edges.

| Graph Representation | Space Complexity | Add Edge Time | Check Edge Time | Traversal Time
| ------------------ | -------  | ---- | ------ | ------ |
| Adjacency Matrix   | O(V^2)   | O(1) | O(1)   | O(V^2) |
| Adjacency List     | O(V+E)   | O(1) | O(deg) | O(V+E) |
| Edge List          | O(E)     | O(1) | O(E)   | O(E)   |

Here we are using a Adjacency List.

### Chapter 4 : The hard part, finding every possible playable words on the board
The core challenge of the Boogle game lies in identifying all the valid words that can be formed on the board using a *combination* of adjacent letters. This involves a combination of Depth-First Search (`DFS`), `Trie`, and `graph` traversal to systematically explore all possible paths and efficiently check whether they form valid words.

Since some words share prefixes, it‚Äôs **inefficient** to check all possible letter combinations blindly. Instead, we optimize this by abandoning paths where prefixes do not match any valid word in the dictionary.

```csharp
public SortedList<string, string> getAllValidWordsOnBoard(TrieNode trieNode)
{
   SortedList<string, string> sortedWordList = new();
   bool[,] visited;

   // Loop through all nodes in the graph
   foreach (Node<char> node in _graph.Graph.Keys){
      visited = new bool[_boardWidth, _boardHeight];
      DFS(visited, node, string.Empty); // Start DFS from each node
   }

   void DFS(bool[,] visited, Node<char> node, string currentPrefix){
      if (visited[node.Row, node.Col]) return;
      visited[node.Row, node.Col] = true;
      string dfsPrefix = currentPrefix + node.Value;
      
      if (!Trie.SearchPrefix(trieNode, dfsPrefix)){ // Check if the prefix exists in the trie
         visited[node.Row, node.Col] = false;
         return; // Backtrack if the prefix doesn't exist in the Trie
      }
      // If a complete word is found, add it to the result list
      if (Trie.SearchKey(trieNode, dfsPrefix)){
         sortedWordList[dfsPrefix] = dfsPrefix;
      }
      // Recursively explore all neighbors
      if (_graph.Graph.TryGetValue(node, out HashSet<Node<char>> neighbors)){
         foreach (Node<char> neighbor in neighbors)
         {
            bool[,] newVisited = (bool[,])visited.Clone(); // Avoid revisiting nodes in the same path
            DFS(newVisited, neighbor, dfsPrefix);
         }
      }
   }
   return sortedWordList;
}
```

**Detailed Explanation of the Algorithm :**
1. Graph Setup: We initialize a graph where each node corresponds to a letter on the board. An adjacency matrix is created to capture the connections between adjacent nodes (letters).

2. DFS Initialization: We start a DFS from every node on the board, treating each letter as a potential starting point for a word. At each step, we build a string representing the current word path.

3. Prefix Checking: As we build each word path, we check if the current prefix exists in the Trie. If it doesn't, the search terminates early for that path. This prevents unnecessary exploration of paths that cannot lead to a valid word.

4. Word Validation: If the current string matches a full word in the Trie, it is added to a `SortedList<string, string>` of valid words. This ensures that only words present in the dictionary are considered valid, the utilization of SortedList gives us the opportunity the use the mandatory .

## Conlusion :
This project was in fact interesting by putting us in one hand on the utilization and implementation of simple relatively simple things, like creating a board, players, looping through external `.txt` files.
On the other hand, more basic understanding of data structures and algorithms is required like **graph theory**, **set theory**, **DFS approach** and much more by letting us dive into the wild with only ***arrays*** and ***loops***.
Learning to gather unlearned informations was a key method to succeed in the project.
